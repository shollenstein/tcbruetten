   To display the details of the blocking you can use $stats[x] changing x to a number from this list

   -1 - Timestamp of when spam block count was started/reset
    0  - Total count
    1  - Filled in the Honeypot
    2  - You have banned their IP
    3  - They didn't fill in the anti bot test
    4  - They got the anti bot test wrong
    5  - No timehash
    6  - They failed the header check
    7  - Post contained a blocked word
    8  - Post contained to many URLs
    9  - Stop Forum Spam thinks they are a spammer
    
    But I dont recommend displaying anyting other than the total count and the date
